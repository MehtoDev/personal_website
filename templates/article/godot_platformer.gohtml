    <h1><big>3D platformer - Godot</big><br><small>(Status : Abandoned/Finished)</small></h1>
    <p class="content_paragraph">Let's travel back in time little while to August 2023. A new entry in the genre of rage-games similar to 'Getting over it with Bennett Foddy' has been released and everyone seems to be playing it, raging as they lose all of their hard earned progress in the climb to the heavens. The game I'm talking about, is of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Up!">'Only Up!'</a>. I tried the game, thought it was interesting and naturally chose to <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/only_up/runs/mrlw178m">speedrun</a> the game. </p><p class="content_paragraph"> After spending far too many hours on the game, I got curious and wondered, whether I could replicate the gameplay loop and perhaps improve on it. I had a simple idea along the lines of "Hey, what if I add a grappling hook?". I booted up Godot and got to work. Below is a video demonstrating how far I got into the project, before burning out on the concept of 'Only Up!' (I'm sure spending hundred and hundreds of hours speedrunning the original had nothing to do with this). I also figured that I had learned enough from the effort to not spend the time it would require to create all the graphical assets and animations it would require to turn the concept into a finished game.</p>
